# OrderHandler

A test project simulating an ever increasing number of orders being generated and consumed .

You said to have fun, and I did - it was quite an interesting exercise. 
Looking forward to going through it with you and justifying the bad bits (there are bad bits).

## Known Issues

- Design of the system needs a bit of refactoring - time constraint got to me.
- CTRL+C unceremoniously kills eveything and exits with a horrendous exit code - there's no attempt to gracefully shut down and clean up.
- Unit testing is incomplete to put it kindly.
